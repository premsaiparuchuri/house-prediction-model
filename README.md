# house-prediction-model
This repository contains a simple House Price Prediction model implemented using Python. The project follows a structured process, including data cleaning, model development using Ridge regression, and the creation of a web-based user interface using Flask.

Key Components

**Data Cleaning: The model utilizes a dataset from Kaggle (Seattle House Price Prediction). The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, categorical data, and other preprocessing steps.

Model Development: The machine learning model is implemented using Ridge regression, leveraging the scikit-learn library. The trained model is saved for later use.

Flask Web Application: The project incorporates a Flask web application, providing a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices. Users can input details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, and zip code to receive a price prediction.**
